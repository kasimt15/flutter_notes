# flutter_notes

This is my first Flutter project called Flutter Notes, a simple note taking app that connects to a PostGres database and with a backend built on Django. Whenever a use logs in and creates/edit note it gets send to the database and notes can also be retrieved and displayed in the frontend, also that feature is a work in progress.
